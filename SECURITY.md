## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

- **For Sensitive Vulnerabilities**: Please use GitHub's **private vulnerability reporting** feature. This is the preferred method as it ensures the issue is not publicly disclosed before a patch is available. You can do this by navigating to the "Security" tab of our repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability."

- **For Non-Sensitive Security Issues**: If you have a security concern that is not a critical vulnerability, feel free to open a **GitHub Issue**. Please provide a detailed description of the issue and the potential impact.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much detail as possible, including:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any proof-of-concept code.

We will do our best to respond to your report within 48-72 hours and will keep you informed of our progress as we work to resolve the issue. We thank you for your help in keeping MediMind AI secure.
